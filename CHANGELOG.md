# Changelog

## v0.2.0 - 2025-05-14

- **Breaking**: `makedocs` now renders a separate build for each `base` needed by vitepress, for example `v1.2.3`, `v1.2`, `v1` and `stable`. This fixes problems stemming from the non-relocatability of vitepress sites (the base they have been rendered for must be the same as where it is deployed). Because the structure of the `build` folder changes and now contains subfolders which must be deployed separately, `Documenter.deploydocs` cannot be used anymore. Instead, use the function of similar name `DocumenterVitepress.deploydocs` which wraps Documenter's function in a way that handles the multi-folder setup correctly [#246](https://github.com/LuxDL/DocumenterVitepress.jl/pull/246). You will also have to delete every symlink on the `gh-pages` branch which Documenter has written and which you want to deploy to using DocumenterVitepress, for example `stable` will be a symlink but needs to be removed before DocumenterVitepress can render to an actual directory there. For more information check the README.
- Added the ability to write inventories using [DocInventories](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/DocInventories.jl) [#249](https://github.com/LuxDL/DocumenterVitepress.jl/pull/249)
